## Welcome to the Advocate Health Storybook

The Advocate Health Component Library is aimed squarely at making life easier for
the digital developers, designers, and product managers who work on Advocate Health digital properties.
As the Component Library evolves, the goal is to bring a level of visual and interactive consistency
to the many digital products and platforms by documenting common UI/UX patterns and presentations.

The Component Library also maintains brand guidelines, components, and resources that have been created to help
the organization build products for our customers more efficiently. It is intended to be the single source of truth for
product teams working on Advocate Health digital properties as to ensure design and development effort is as
efficient, consistent, and collaborative as possible.

## Component Library Goals

1. Collaboration
A main goal of this Component Library is to make it easy for designers and developers to work together
and to encourage collaboration. The team uses Figma Variables to allow designers to define and document the design tokens
required to make up the designs.
A custom-built Figma plugin allows for the export of these design tokens to be used seamlessly in CSS files by developers.
This dramatically increases the speed of the process by translating designs into code and ensures that the code and designs are always in sync.

2. Consistency
Using Storybook as a platform for the Component Library allows us to build a living, breathing, interactive style guide
that can be used to document and demonstrate the components and patterns that make up production applications.

3. Accessibility
The Component Library is built with accessibility in mind. The components are designed to be accessible to all users,
including those who use assistive technologies. The library is tested with screen readers and other assistive technologies
to ensure that it meets the highest standards of accessibility.

4. Performance
This Component Library strives to be performant. The components are built with performance in mind and are optimized for speed.
By straying away from heavy npm packages and using a more minimalistic approach, the library is able to maintain a
high level of performance and speed.

5. Developer Experience
Maintaining a high level of developer experience is a key goal of this Component Library. The components are designed to be easy to use
and easy to understand. The library is well-documented and includes examples and best practices for using the components.
Specific libraries and tools have been chosen to make the development process as smooth as possible.
