# Architecture Overview
This document provides an overview of the architecture of the React Component Library.
It outlines the structure, key components, and philosophies behind the Component Library. It is important to note that
this project tries to frame itself as CMS-agnostic, meaning that it should be able to be used in any CMS or web application.
As it stands today, the project has a heavy focus on Sitecore and many of the components are built with Sitecore in mind.

This architecture is subject to change as the project evolves and grows and should be maintained as a living document.
