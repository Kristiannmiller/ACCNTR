# Components Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the components used in our React Component Library.
The components are organized following the Atomic Design methodology, which helps in creating a scalable and
maintainable design system.

## Atomic Design Methodology
The components are categorized into three main types:

- **Atoms**: The most basic building blocks, such as buttons, inputs, and labels.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that work together as a unit, like a form group with a label and input.
- **Organisms**: Complex components that can be added directly to a page, such as headers, footers, and forms.

## Key Folders
- **components/atoms**: Contains the atomic components.
- **components/molecules**: Contains the molecular components.
- **components/organisms**: Contains the organism components.

### Additional Folders
- **components/pages**: Contains the page components. These are *not* exported from the library and
are used for documentation purposes only. This provides a way to see how the components are used together.
- **components/svgs**: Contains the SVG components.
- **components/templates**: Contains the template components. These are common layouts that can be used to build pages.

## Example Component
Here is an example of how to use a component from the library:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ahc-digital/component-library';

const Example = () => {
  return(
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>
        Click Me
    </Button>
  );
};
```

    <summary><strong>What best practices do the components follow?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Imports should be organized in the following order: React, third-party libraries, local imports. Each are separated by comments.</li>
        <li>Component props should not be destructured inline. Instead, destructure them in the function signature.</li>
        <li>Components should be exported as named exports. Avoid default exports for naming consistency.</li>
        <li>Prefer explicit return statements instead of implicit returns.</li>
    </ul>
