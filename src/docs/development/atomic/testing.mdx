# Tests Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the testing strategy and practices used in our React Component Library.
It outlines the structure, key components, and tools used for testing.

## Testing Strategy
We follow a comprehensive testing strategy for unit tests. Each component should have a corresponding test file that
ensures its functionality. It is important to test the components in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
Testing a component's positive and negative cases based on the args is also important. This provides a full coverage
of the capabilities of the component.

## Key Folders
- **tests/**: Contains all the test files for the components. Each component has a corresponding test file to ensure its functionality.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **React Testing Library**: A simple and complete testing library for React that encourages good testing practices.
- **Storybook**: An open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation. We use Storybook for visual testing.

## Example Test
Here is an example of a test for the `Testimonials` component:

```typescript
import { StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { within } from '@storybook/testing-library';
import { expect } from '@storybook/jest';

// Components
import { Testimonials } from '@/components';

// Utils
import { classNameRegex, getTextFieldValue } from '@/utils';

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Testimonials>;

const testTestimonialsDefault: Story['play'] = async ({
    canvasElement,
    args
}) => {
    const { getByTestId, getAllByTestId } = within(canvasElement);
    ...
};

export const testTestimonials = {
    default: testTestimonialsDefault
};
```

    <p>To run the tests, Storybook must be running. In each individual story, run the test runner and watch for execution.</p>
