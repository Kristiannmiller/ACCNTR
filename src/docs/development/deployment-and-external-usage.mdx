# Deployment and External Usage
The Component Library is designed to be deployed as a standalone application or integrated into other projects.
It is meant to be published to npm and consumed by other React projects as a dependency in a tech-agnostic way.
External usage of the Component Library is encouraged and should be documented in the README file of the project.

## Key Components
There are a few key components that are essential to the Component Library and should be used in any project that consumes the library.

### ThemeProvider
The `ThemeProvider` is a component that wraps the application and provides the theme to all styled components the library.
It must wrap the `<body>` tag at the root of the application and a data-theme argument must be passed. The example
below demonstrates how to use the `ThemeProvider` in an application.

```tsx
import { DEFAULT_THEME, ThemeProvider } from '@ahc-digital/component-library';

const App = () => {
  const siteTheme = DEFAULT_THEME;

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={siteTheme}>
      <body>
        <Main />
      </body>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Importing Components
The components in this library are exported as named exports along with relevant type definitions. When importing a component,
it is important to import the component and the type definition to preserve type-safety in the application.

*Note: The majority of the components that are exported from this library are in the `organisms` folder.*

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ahc-digital/component-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      variant='primary'
      onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```
