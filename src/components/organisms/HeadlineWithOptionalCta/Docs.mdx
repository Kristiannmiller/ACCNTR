Description: The headline CTA is a simple component consisting of headline text plus a CTA button to be used primarily on Service pages.
The headline will vary per page but the button will often be the same across a section of the site. As a result, this rendering will consist of two separate renderings, the headline which exposes a placeholder for the button, and the button itself.
