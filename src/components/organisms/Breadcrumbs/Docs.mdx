# Breadcrumbs

Story Link: [#19](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/19)

Description: The breadcrumbs component displays a list of links that shows the user's current location within the site hierarchy. Each page from the closest designated root to the current page will be displayed as a list of links separated by carats. The current page should be the last element in the list and be bolded. The list will be populated automatically by the content tree and is not manually authored.

# Acceptance Criteria

The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

-   Rendering parameters are created and match the specification in "Sitecore Details" section
-   Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor

For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Breadcrumbs are hidden by default on mobile.

Breadcrumbs have a max width of 1440px and wrap to two lines as needed.

Link titles are pulled from the page's "Navigation Title" field. If "Navigation Title" is not filled out, the Sitecore item name should be used instead.

Items are added to the breadcrumb from the right and follow the Sitecore tree structure.

The current page is the last element in the list. It should be bolded and is not a link
