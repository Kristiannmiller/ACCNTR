# SidePhotoContentCardCarousel

Story Link: [#175]('https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/175')

Description: The side photo content card carousel is a carousel component that is made up of side photo content cards. The presentation of each slide matches that of a side photo content card with the addition of the carousel controls. The carousel is populated by adding multiple side photo content cards to a placeholder that then builds a carousel from them.

# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

- Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
- Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
- For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

- Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

- Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

- The top of the container should be the anchor target with the id from the rendering parameter.

- In Experience Editor, each slide is stacked on top of each other for ease of editing.

- Content authors are able to edit the slide timing (default is 6 seconds).

- All slides should be forced to have the same layout, as dictated by the carousel itself. This overrides any layout options on the component cards
