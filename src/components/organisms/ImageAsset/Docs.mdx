# ImageAsset

Story Link: [#235](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/235)

Description: The image asset component allows content authors to add an image asset with an optional text caption.

---
# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

- Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
- Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor

For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component
must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

Caption is optional but if supplied, should always be positioned below the image asset and is aligned to the left. Caption should
always be the same width as the image on desktop/tablet and is always full width on mobile.

Content authors are able to supply a WEBP/JPG/PNG as an image asset. The alt text should be pulled dynamically from the media library but can be overwritten via the Image field properties.

Content authors are able to add a link to the image asset.

Image asset should retain original image sizing but should not exceed width of the container.
