Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

Caption is optional but if supplied, should always be positioned below the video asset and is aligned to the left.

Video asset should always be 100% the width of its container.

Video controls are consistent with the default YouTube API that we've already implemented.
