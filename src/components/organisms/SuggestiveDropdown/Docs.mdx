# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

 - Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
 - Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor

For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

The top of the container should be the anchor target with the id from the rendering parameter.

As the user types, the list of options should reduce to options that match the text being type. All options should show initially when the input is first selected and nothing is typed.

When the user selects an item from the dropdown, focus should move to the submit button.

Links will be displayed in the list of options in the order that they are added in Sitecore.
