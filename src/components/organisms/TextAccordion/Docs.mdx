# TextAccordion

Story Link: [#131]('https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/131')

Description: The text accordion is a simple accordion component that allows content authors to display rich text on the page that is hidden by a "Show More".

---
# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

- Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
- Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

- Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

- The text within the "Always Visible Text" field is the text that appears above the "Show More" button. The bottom line of this text should be faded.

- The text within the "Hidden Text" is what appears after the "Show More" button is pressed.

- When expanded, the "Show More" button should change to "Show Less" and collapse the accordion again when pressed. When "Show Less" is pressed, it should anchor the user back to the top of the component.
