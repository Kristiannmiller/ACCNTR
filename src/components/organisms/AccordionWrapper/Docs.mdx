# AccordionWrapper

Story Link: [#58](https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/58)

Description: We need an AccordionWrapper molecule so that we can export the title and description along with the Accordion into Sitecore
             The styles should match what is in Figma. See parent story for details.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:
  - Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section.
  - Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
- For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.
- Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.
- All items should be collapsed by default on page load. If the the "Open First Item" rendering parameter is checked, the first accordion item should be opened by default.
- Clicking anywhere on the Accordion Item title bar should expand that accordion item.
- When expanded the '+' icon should change to a '-' icon.
- Multiple accordion items should be able to be opened at a time, unless the "Limit to single item" rendering parameter is checked.
- Accordion placeholder is configured to accept only Accordion Item renderings and no other renderings can be added.
- Anchors within an accordion pane should trigger the opening of that pane when navigated to.
