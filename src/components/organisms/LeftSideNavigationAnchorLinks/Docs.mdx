Story Link: [#129]('https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/129')

Description: The Left Anchor Links component is a component that consists of links arranged in a hierarchical fashion similar to the left navigation and occupies the same left hand column space as the left navigation. It has a different visual design from the left navigation and is intended to be made entirely of author curated anchor links instead of building off the Sitecore content tree automatically.

---
# Acceptance Criteria

The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

On desktop the left navigation anchor links is sticky as the user scrolls.

On mobile the left navigation anchor links collapses. Instead of being stick a "Back to Top" button appears in the bottom right.

Items in the left navigation anchor links component should be highlighted as the user reaches that anchor on the page.
