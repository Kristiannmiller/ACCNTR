# Header

Story Link (GlobalNavigation): [#28](https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/28)

Story Link (UtilityNavigation): [#20]('https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/20')

The Header organism is an arrangement of the GlobalNavigation and UtilityNavigation molecules. 
It is used to provide a consistent header across all pages of the site.
This component acts as a manager for the two; and controls things like the 'stickiness' of the header, and the visibility of the UtilityNavigation.

### Order of precedence for mobile "Featured Utility Link"
1. **Featured Utility Link**: If the `featuredUtilityCtaNumber` is set, it will be displayed in the main nav on mobile.
2. **Call Link**: If the `featuredUtilityCtaNumber` is not present, and the `callLink` is set, it will be displayed in the main nav on mobile. 
3. **Search Button**: If neither of the above are set, the search button will be displayed in the main nav on mobile.
4. **None**. If none of the above are set, only the mobile menu button will be displayed in the main nav on mobile.
