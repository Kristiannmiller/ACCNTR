Story Link: [#158](https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/158)

We want to create Kitchen Sink pages which represent the 3 main page layouts we require. This is to show how our grid structure is working as to see how components interact with each other prior to getting imported into Sitecore.

Basic Page with Left Navigation (Example: https://www.advocatehealth.com/about-us/)
Basic Page without Left Navigation (Example: https://www.advocatehealth.com/contact-us/medical-records)
Home Page (Example: https://www.advocatehealth.com/)

---
# Acceptance Criteria
All pages contain, header, footer, and merged components to show how they are displayed in different scenarios.
