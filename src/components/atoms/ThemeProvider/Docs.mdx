# ThemeProvider

Description: The ThemeProvider is a Slot that does 2 things:
- Sets the ThemeContext (React context) for use in the JavaScript.
- Applies the data-theme attribute to the children HTML elements for use in the CSS.

**Important**: The ThemeProvider must wrap the `<body>` tag at the root of the application.
This ensures all styles are applied correctly - specifically modals, which are appended to the bottom of the body.
