# Acceptance Criteria

The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

- Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
- Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor

For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

The root tabs component only allows for tabs to be added.

Content authors are able to select between large text and small text for the tab titles. This is done at a root level an applies to all tabs at once.

In Experience Editor, all tabs should show and stack on top of each other.
