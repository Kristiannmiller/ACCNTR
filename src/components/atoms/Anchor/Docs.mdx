# Anchor

Story Link: [#27](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/27)

Description: The anchor atom component is for page links and will be used across a variety of molecules and organisms.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

-   Anchor components should use the same CVA variants as [[Button]].
-   Anchor components should use the same CVA variants as [[Text]].
-   All sizes and variants that apply to buttons also apply to anchors.
-   The default variant is undefined.
-   When the variant is undefined, the Anchor renders as a link.
-   medium is the default size.
-   When the variant is undefined, the size prop does not apply.
-   When asChild is true, use a Radix slot to merge props and styles with the child element.
-   Two themes Consumer and Corporate are toggled based on a parent data attribute data-theme="Consumer" or data-theme="Corporate"
-   Under the Corporate theme, to render the link as a button, the variant must be populated. However, it doesn't matter which variant is selected since there is only one Corporate button style.
-   All states and styles must be viewable in Storybook.
-   For example, add a control for disabled.
