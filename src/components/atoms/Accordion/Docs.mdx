# Accordion

Story Link: [17](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/17)

Description: The accordion component consists of multiple accordion items that can be expanded to reveal a section of rich text. The accordion may optionally have a title and supporting copy that sits above the accordion items, and another optional set of supporting copy that sits below the accordion items.

# Acceptance Criteria

The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc.) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

All items should be collapsed by default on page load. If the "Open First Item" rendering parameter is checked, the first accordion item should be opened by default.

Clicking anywhere on the Accordion Item title bar should expand that accordion item.

When expanded the '+' icon should change to a '-' icon.

Multiple accordion items should be able to be opened at a time, unless the "Limit to single item" rendering parameter is checked.

Accordion placeholder is configured to accept only Accordion Item renderings and no other renderings can be added.

Anchors within an accordion pane should trigger the opening of that pane when navigated to.

If "Is FAQ" is checked for an accordion item, the schema.org markup should be added for that item.

Title style should update to reflect semantic tag when changed. (Open question, still needs to be confirmed)
