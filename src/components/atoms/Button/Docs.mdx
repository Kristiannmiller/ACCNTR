# Button

Story Link: [#16](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/16)

Description: The button atom component will be used across a variety of molecules and organisms.

#### Important Notes:
- Corporate: Variants and Sizes are ignored. As a design decision, there is not a hover state for "solid-1-inverse".
- Consumer: There is no "light2" theme for desktop.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Code is copied and modified from Button - shadcn/ui (manual installation)
- Can be used as a button or a link.
- The button is rendered as shown in Figma based on the provided size and variant props; and the various states for the button (Default, Hover, Disabled, etc.)
  - `medium` is the default size.
  - `solid-1` is the default variant.
- When `asChild` is true, use a Radix slot to merge props and styles with the child element.
- Two themes `Consumer` and `Corporate` are toggled based on a parent data attribute data-theme="Consumer" or data-theme="Corporate"
- Under the `Corporate` theme, in accordance with the Figma designs, the variant prop is ignored.
- All states and styles must be viewable in Storybook.
  - For example, add a control for disabled.
