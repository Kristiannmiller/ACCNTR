# Container

Story Link: [#59](https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/59)

The Container component has the following responsibilities:
- Horizontally center the content.
- Set the max-width of the content.
- Set the padding of the content.
- Set the container-type property for [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries).

Note: the max-width and padding are applied to the direct children of the `Container`. Because they are in the `core` layer,
they can easily be overridden to accomadate different design requirements - so long as the overridden styles are not also in the `core` laer.
They are simply a default that should apply to most use cases.
