# GlobalNavigation

Story Link: [#28](https://github.com/ahc-digital/component-library/issues/28)

The GlobalNavigation molecule is a set of links that sit below the utility navigation. 
It consists of a set of a logo, primary links that are used to navigate the site, and a search bar. 
The global navigation may optionally open a drop down that reveals a further set of links. 
Content Authors can additionally choose from a limited set of color options for the primary links.

# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

The primary navigation is pinned to the top of the screen on scroll but shrinks. Utility nav disappears on scroll down and reappears on scroll up.

Clicking search expands the nav down, showing the search input. Focus should automatically be applied to the search input field.

Primary Navigation Sections show the sub menu, expanding down, when clicked.

Content authors are able to choose between a white background and transparent background.

Authors are able to specify a navigation link that sits outside the collapsed menu on mobile.

Authors are able to specify an optional icon that appears only on mobile.

Authors are able to specify optional text for navigation links that is only used on mobile.

Search will appear on mobile at the top of the expanded menu automatically.

Colored bars under the sections (i.e. Children's Hospital) will be handled via a class on the link field.

Section text for the section the visitor is currently in should bolded when the user is that section. (Follow up with Design)
