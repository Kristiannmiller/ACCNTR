# LocationCard

Story Link: [#228](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/228)

Description: The Location Cards are a card based component that pulls in data from location objects.

---
# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

- Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
- Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor

For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

The location details for the card should come automatically from the linked location object.

An optional 50% dark overlay with the "360" watermark can be applied to each card via a rendering parameter. The watermark is 80% opacity by default and becomes 100% on hover.

On desktop, there should be 3 cards per row. On tablet there are 2 cards per row. On mobile, all cards are stacked.

The image on the card should be wrapped in in the tour link on the location option if available.
