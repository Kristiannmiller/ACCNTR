Story Link: [#294](https://github.com/ahc-digital/migration-planning-tracking/issues/294)

Description: The Find a Location component wraps the find-a-location embedded integration with a search field.

---
# Acceptance Criteria
The component is created within Sitecore and meets the following criteria:

Template name and structure matches specification in "Sitecore Details" section
Content authors are able to add, modify, and remove the component via experience editor
For ADA, component should be fully operable via keyboard (tab index, panel toggling, etc) without mouse interaction. Component must also pass Storybook ADA plugin validation.

Component is added to storybook, and each content author editable field is editable within storybook.

Should implement the exclude from translation class around the entire component.

When form submits the field values are added as query string parameters and it redirects to the page containing the Reputation widget.

All form placeholder text will come from the dictionary items.

Both fields are required to be filled out before the form can be submitted. The submit button should be greyed out until validation passes.

The location field should provide a 'use precise location' option to use the browser location for searching. This should trigger a browser modal to ask for permission. Use the browser's default behavior for remembering the permission.

All form fields should be sanitized and filter out most special characters.

There is no auto complete on the form fields.
