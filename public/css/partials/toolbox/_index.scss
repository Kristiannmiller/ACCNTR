// TODO: Find if there's a way to remove the layers declaration from here.
// Related issue: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/23990
// tl;dr: The order of the .modules.scss files in the <head> is not guaranteed to come after the index.css in Storybook.
// So, we need to declare the layers here so that the priority order is always defined up front, no matter which stylesheet is loaded first.
// If this isn't here, the @atoms layer, for example could be declared before @core and would have a lower priority.
